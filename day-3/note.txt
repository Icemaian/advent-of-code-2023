Gear Ratios:
	Problem statement:
		given a sheet containing digits and symbols determine the sum of digits that have a symbol within one step away. That step can be diagonal, above, below, or beside. Empty spaces are represented by periods and do not count as symbols
	Approach:
		1: First we'll read in the first line and save it to an list called currLine
		2: Then we'll read in the next line and save it to an list called nextLine
		3: With both in memory we'll being processing the data by
			a: reading each char, if its a digit save it to a string called canidate.
			b: once we hit a period we want to check if a symbol is above or below. 
				- For below we'll use the index of the current point, taking into account to catch we dont go beyond the bounds of the list
				- For above we'll use the same process
			c: after we've finished a line we'll save the currLine to the list prevLine, save currLine to nextLine, and read in the nextLine from the input file

Gear Ratios part 2:
	Problem State: 
		given the same sheet we now need to add the multiplicity of exactly two numbers that are within direct contact with a *.
	Approach: 
		1: Taking the same window approach we will now search for a * icon instead of a digit. some caveats though...
			a: It specifies excatly two part numbers so if only one is present we don't count it
			b: It does not specify if part numbers can be re-used or not, for now I am assuming they can
		2: once we identify the multiplicity we'll add it to a new totalGear value
