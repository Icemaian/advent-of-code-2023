Trebuchet:	
	problem statement: Each line contains a calibration value, the value is found by combining the first digit and the last (not addition). After every digit is found sum the values
	Approach: 
		1: Define file path, result variable, and performance variables
		2: Read in file, using chunks to prevent overflow
		3: Loop through each line and keep track of index for performance metric and traceability
		4: for each line we want to
			a: grab the length of the string
			b: Start from 0 index and loop through chars till we find a digit
			c: Start at the end of the index and reverse through the chars till we find a digit
			d: finally combine the two digits as chars and append to the result array as type int
		5: For summing the array:
			a: If the array is greater than two split and call the function again for each half
			b: Else sum the two digit and return the sum
