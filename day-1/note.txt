Trebuchet part 1:	
	Problem statement: Each line contains a calibration value, the value is found by combining the first digit and the last (not addition). After every digit is found sum the values
	Approach: 
		1: Define file path, result variable, and performance variables
		2: Loop through each line and keep track of index for shifting the window
		3: for each line we want to
			a: grab the length of the string
			b: Start from 0 index and loop through chars till we find a digit
			c: Start at the end of the index and reverse through the chars till we find a digit
			d: finally combine the two digits as chars and append to the result array as type int
		4: For summing the array:
			a: If the array is greater than two split and call the function again for each half
			b: Else sum the two digit and return the sum
	
Trebuchet part 2:
	Problem statement: Inside the input there is actually english strings in the text that represent valid digits, limited to 0-9
	Approach:
		1: Define a function that can take in a string and find and replace the first valid string and the last
			a: we'll use a dict that we'll loop through for determining if our window has valid input
			b: our window will start at one char long and grow to at max 5
			c: once a valid int or str representation of int is found in the window break and return it.
